# UCSDUnfoldingMaps
module6 and it's modification

5月份的时候在线听了USCD的OOP课程，感觉受益颇多。虽然最后的大作业只是在理解原程序的基础上做了一些无关紧要的修改，但也发现了在java中调用processing的乐趣。以及原程序中使用的是google map，我将其换成了MS提供的地图。程序和结果都已上传。

English Version:
I finished USCD's OOP course online in May. Although the last project I did was just to make some insignificant modifications based on understanding the original program, I found the fun of calling "processing" in java. The original program is based on Google Map, I replaced it with the map provided by MS.The program and results have been uploaded.
